In this project I will create a basic web calculator that function as a simple pocket calculator.
The intent is to have a calculator that always performs the current operation before moving on to the next one. 
The result of each opperation will be displayed before user can move on to the next operation. 
The display will show the curent number and proceed to show the operator, followed by the next operand. 
Once a new operator is chosen for the next operation, the current operation will be resolved. the display will the update and show the result of teh curent operation and the operand that was chosen for the new operation. I will then await for the next opperand to be imputed. 
In the case where the user use the iquality sign, the operation will be resolved and only the result will be displayed. Further operator and eoprand can then be added to said result to computer a new operation.  
A clear butting will also be added to the Ui. This button will clear any existing data and Ui display. 
A backspace functionality will be added to the calculator. This functionality will clear the latest user input. If pressed more then once the functionality will continue to clear users input in order or most recent to oldest untill all data is cleard. 
The display will shot "Error" if user attempts to divide by 0
The maximum amount of decimals slots allowed for each number will be 9. Further decisions on this can potentially be made later.
